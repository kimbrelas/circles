Create a real-time collaborative drawing game:
Users can access a URL and select up to 10 circles from the screen. Other users on the page can see the circles update in real-time, as selections are made. If the user exhausts their 10 circles, they have to click on their selected circles to deselect them. Others can't take over a circle that's already selected.

Users see:

    Circles:
        Their selected circles in dark blue
        Others selected circles in light blue
        Available circles in gray
    Countdown of their selected circles out of 10
    A running tally of number of users online (optional)
    Brief help messages to figure out the game (optional)
    Ability to swipe on mobile and desktop to navigate the drawing (optional)
    Zoom in and zoom out (optional)
